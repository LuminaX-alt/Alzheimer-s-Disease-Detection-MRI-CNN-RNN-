# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Detection-MRI-CNN-RNN-
Detecting Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) using MRI scans with CNN and/or RNN models is one of the most impactful deep learning applications in healthcare.
ðŸ§  Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Detection using MRI, CNN, RNN
âœ… 1. Problem Statement
Detect if a person is:

Normal

Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)

Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD)

Using brain MRI images, the goal is to classify the stage of Alzheimer's for early diagnosis.

3. Architecture
âœ… CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
Used for 2D or 3D feature extraction from MRI slices

Layers: Conv2D â†’ ReLU â†’ MaxPooling â†’ Dropout â†’ Dense

Output: Multi-class classification (CN, MCI, AD)

âœ… RNN or LSTM (if using MRI slices as sequences)
Treat slices across brain regions as time steps

Used when 3D volume is converted into sequential 2D slices

Combines spatial + sequential features
